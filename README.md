# DataDrivenFramework
Data driven framework for Selenium project in java
This project implements a Data-Driven Testing (DDT) framework using Selenium WebDriver in Java to enhance test automation by separating test data from test scripts. 
It reads input data from external sources like Excel (Apache POI), CSV, or databases, allowing for efficient testing of multiple scenarios with minimal code changes. 
The framework supports parameterized tests, logging (Log4j), and report generation (Extent Reports) for better analysis. 
It follows industry best practices with a modular structure, ensuring code reusability and maintainability. 
This solution helps improve test coverage, reduces redundancy, and enables easy scaling of test cases for web applications.
